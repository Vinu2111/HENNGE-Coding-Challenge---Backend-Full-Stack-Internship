# HENNGE-Coding-Challenge---Backend-Full-Stack-Internship
This repository contains my solution for the HENNGE backend/full-stack internship coding challenge. The solution is implemented in Python, following all given constraints, including avoiding loops and comprehensions. The program calculates the sum of squares of non-negative integers from multiple test cases.
